# The Woods Creek Trail in Lexington, Va

This project maps the Woods Creek trail in Lexington, Va and highlights some of the features to see and other useful information for those interested in visiting the trail.

## Map Data
Trail data was collected using a SX Blue II+ GNSS receiver.

The streams and water bodies, roads, and building data were acquired from the [Virginia GIS Clearinghouse](https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/pages/clearinghouse).

Conserved lands data was acquired from the [Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation](https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/clinfo).

## Tools
This map was created using QGIS 3.24 on Windows 11.

## Map Process

The GNSS receiver collected data at a .... interval and exported the data as a shapefile which was then uploaded to QGIS (This is a guess on the process, a few sentences here might help viewers see the link from the GNSS receiver to the final map!)
