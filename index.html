            <h3>About the Map</h3>

            <p>This map of the Woods Creek trail highlights some of the features to see and other useful information for those interested in visiting the trail.</p>
            <p>The Woods Creek trail is a short, urban trail that runs along the Woods Creek and passes through two college campuses (Washington & Lee and Virginia Military Institute) and several parks. It's located near several other trails, which are noted on the map.</p>

            <p>Trail data was collected using a SX II+ Blue GNSS receiver. The streams and water bodies, roads, and building data were acquired from the <a href="https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/pages/clearinghouse" target="_blank">GIS Clearinghouse</a>. Conserved lands data was acquired from the <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/clinfo" target="_blank">Department of Conservation and Recreation</a>.</p>
